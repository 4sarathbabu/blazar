    The resource monitoring feature is available from this release.
    This feature monitors states of resources in the freepool. If any failure
    is detected, reservations which suffer from the failure are healed.
    New flags have been introduced into leases and reservations to indicate
    health of reserved resources.
    Resource monitor is plugable and the compute host resource monitor is
    currently supported. See documentation [1]_ in detail.
